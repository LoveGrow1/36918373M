        <h4>Active Listening:</h4>
        <p>Make it a point to engage more actively when your partner is discussing their emotions. This might mean putting away distractions, making eye contact, and responding in a way that shows you truly understand and empathize. This can be challenging at times, but your effort will communicate care and understanding.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Encourage Open Communication:</h4>
        <p>Assure your partner that they can always express their desires or concerns freely. This can be done through consistent positive reinforcement whenever she opens up about her wants or concerns. It will require patience and openness from your end.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Shared Decision Making:</h4>
        <p>As you've been together for 90 months and have 2 kids, it's important that decisions affecting the family involve input from both of you. Establish regular check-ins or discussions about major decisions. This may seem tedious, but it can greatly enhance the feeling of partnership and shared responsibility in your relationship.</p>
